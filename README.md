Task 1: Chat with PDF Using RAG Pipeline

The goal is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to
interact with semi-structured data in multiple PDF files. The system should extract, chunk,
embed, and store the data for eFicient retrieval. It will answer user queries and perform
comparisons accurately, leveraging the selected LLM model for generating responses.

Task 2: Chat with Website Using RAG Pipeline

The goal is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to
interact with structured and unstructured data extracted from websites. The system will crawl,
scrape, and store website content, convert it into embeddings, and store it in a vector database.
Users can query the system for information and receive accurate, context-rich responses
generated by a selected LLM.
